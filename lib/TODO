TODO:
- Enforce that column names cannot contain commas, table names neither commas nor dots. We split by comma everywhere.
- getSql() on pers and persQuery. Deprecate getQuery() and replace it with getSql().
- adapter refactoring needed. They still don't support callbacks.
- map refactoring and optimization.
- exec() refactoring and optimization.
- presistanz refactoring to remove _() stuff.
- selectDelete(), multiUpdate()
- serializations: value-map type, date type. Validation.
- unwanted field removal.
- MSSQL support. (linux support for MSSQL is available now.)
- There is no way to escape curly braces in selectAlias(). Find a way.
- Transaction options.
- make getTransaction() callbacks so that the txOptions parameters can be ignored and callback fn can be the first param.
- loadById() too, in callback mode, currently it is necessary to put the "select" argument.
- ignoreTables documentation.
- documentation references tests, but they changed, update.
- test documenation change.
- new bf and toMany name creation algorithm documentation, pers doesn't throw upon failing autogen.
- genericStorage documentation.
- add a section about .group() into the documentation and explain why it's not working like the rest of library and requires selectAlias().
- also put into docs that fields listed in the .selectAlias() don't map to the objects but become properties of the FROM object.

changes:
- Brigde field and toMany field generation completely revamped.
- Persistanz no more throws for failing to autogenerate bridge and toMany fields.
- genericStorage option for parent models with subclasses key.
- ignoreTables config option.
- Bridge field name generation now checks for _Code, _code and Code endings too.
- BREAKING: toMany field names with "-ies" ending for tables whose names end with a "y".
- Proper integration test suite (not complete), Travis-CI (for tests) and coveralls.
- Persistanz.getConfigSummary() lists ignored tables.
- Code cleanup and minor adjustments.
- FIX: if a model in config defined as a function, it was throwing due to some old code remained in v0.5 refactoring.
- FIX: extend = false config option is now respected for auto-generated models too.
- FIX: PersQuery.one() method now returns null instead of undefined when the query returns an empty set.
- FIX: Inserts and update weren't serializing discriminator and [de]serializing the pk.
- FIX: Even if selectAlias() called, query builder was adding '*' to selects if no normal columns added to selects.
- REMOVED: Persistanz.escape() was deprecated and now removed.
