TODO:
- Enforce that column names cannot contain commas, table names neither commas nor dots. We split by comma everywhere.
- getSql() on pers and persQuery. Deprecate getQuery() and replace it with getSql().
- adapter refactoring needed. They still don't support callbacks.
- map refactoring and optimization.
- exec() refactoring and optimization.
- presistanz refactoring to remove _() stuff.
- selectDelete(), multiUpdate()
- serializations: value-map type. Validation.
- unwanted field removal.
- MSSQL support. (linux support for MSSQL is available now.)
- When a table is used as a generic key-value store with different models, foreign keys referring to this table causing generation of
    irrelevant toMany fields for each of the submodels. Moreover, if one the submodels have two references to the generic table pers.create()
    throws "toMany field causing name collision error" for EVERY submodel. Investigate the issue and prepare a fix like "don't generate
    toMany fields for these.".
- Likewise, when pers throws because of multiple possible models exist for a a given fk, consider generating a bridge field only for those
    models whose name is matching the generated bf name. For example, from a generic table that is used as key-value store who has multiple
    sub models, pers cannot create bridge fields. But most of them are irrelevant anyway. If a submodel is ShipType, and Ship table has shipTypeId
    column, there is no need to produce foreign keys for other XType models as they would be irrelevant and unncessarily forces the user
    to define meaningless bridge fileds for models which they won't use anyway.
- There is no way to escape curly braces in selectAlias(). Find a way.
- make getTransaction() callbacks so that the txOptions parameters can be ignored and callback fn can be the first param.
- loadById() too, in callback mode, currently it is necessary to put the "select" argument.
- ignoreTables documentation.
- documentation references tests, but they changed, update.
- test documenation change.
- new bf and toMany name creation algorithm documentation.

changes:
- ignoreTables config option.
- Bridge field name generation now checks for _Code, _code and Code endings too.
- BREAKING: toMany field names with "-ies" ending for tables whose names end with a "y".
- Proper integration test suite, Travis-CI (for tests) and coveralls.
- Persistanz.getConfigSummary() lists ignored tables.
- Code cleanup and minor adjustments.
- FIX: if a model in config defined as a function, it was throwing due to some old code remained in v0.5 refactoring.
- FIX: extend = false config option is now respected for auto-generated models too.
- FIX: PersQuery.one() method now returns null instead of undefined when the query returns an empty set.
- FIX: Inserts and update weren't serializing discriminator and [de]serializing the pk.
- REMOVED: Persistanz.escape() was deprecated and now removed.
