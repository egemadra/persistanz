TODO:
- getSql() on pers and persQuery. Deprecate getQuery() and replace it with getSql().
- adapter refactoring needed. They still don't support callbacks.
- map refactoring and optimization.
- exec() refactoring and optimization.
- presistanz refactoring to remove _() stuff.
- selectDelete(), multiUpdate()
- serializations: value-map type, date type. Validation.
- unwanted field removal.
- MSSQL support. (linux support for MSSQL is available now.)
- There is no way to escape curly braces in selectAlias(). Find a way.
- Transaction options.
- documentation references tests, but they changed, update.
- test documenation change.
- add a section about .group() into the documentation and explain why it's not working like the rest of library and requires selectAlias().
- also put into docs that fields listed in the .selectAlias() don't map to the objects but become properties of the FROM object.
- document PersQuery.affix().

UPDATED:
- FIX: Serialization default was used in update too, now only used in insert.
- affix() method for PersQuery.
- Fix test suite to prevent "deprecated unhandled rejection" errors.
- All async adapter API now accepts callbacks like the rest of the library.
- Mysql and Postgres connect methods now tests the connection instead of throwing later when the connection is used for the first time.
