TODO:
- Enforce that column names cannot contain commas, table names neither commas nor dots. We split by comma everywhere.
- getSql() on pers and persQuery. Deprecate getQuery() and replace it with getSql().
- adapter refactoring needed. They still don't support callbacks.
- map refactoring and optimization.
- exec() refactoring and optimization.
- presistanz refactoring to remove _() stuff.
- selectDelete(), multiUpdate()
- serializations: value-map type. Validation.
- unwanted field removal.
- MSSQL support. (linux support is avaiable now.)
- Unfixable errors are thrown before automatic bridge/toMany field generation. This makes the library unusable even with a single error.
    Check if auto generation routines can work with those errors present.
- When a table is used as a generic key-value store with different models, foreign keys referring to this table causing generation of
    irrelevant toMany fields for each of the submodels. Moreover, if one the submodels have two references to the generic table pers.create()
    throws "toMany field causing name collision error" for EVERY submodel. Investigate the issue and prepare a fix like "don't generate
    toMany fields for these.".
- toMany() doesn't take the root query as the reference point.
- insert as doesn't set the primary key of the .object property even with the autoincrement id. if insert is successful it should
    always assing the pk. check for save as too.
- some tomany fileds not autogenerated. look why.
