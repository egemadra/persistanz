TODO:
- Enforce that column names cannot contain commas, table names neither commas nor dots. We split by comma everywhere.
- getSql() on pers and persQuery. Deprecate getQuery() and replace it with getSql().
- adapter refactoring needed. They still don't support callbacks.
- map refactoring and optimization.
- exec() refactoring and optimization.
- presistanz refactoring to remove _() stuff.
- selectDelete(), multiUpdate()
- serializations: value-map type. Validation.
- unwanted field removal.
- MSSQL support. (linux support is avaiable now.)
- Unfixable errors are thrown before automatic bridge/toMany field generation. This makes the library unusable even with a single error.
    Check if auto generation routines can work with those errors present.
