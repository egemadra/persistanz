TODO:
- getSql() on pers and persQuery. Deprecate getQuery() and replace it with getSql().
- adapter refactoring needed. They still don't support callbacks.
- map refactoring and optimization.
- exec() refactoring and optimization.
- presistanz refactoring to remove _() stuff.
- selectDelete(), multiUpdate()
- serializations: value-map type, date type. Validation.
- unwanted field removal.
- MSSQL support. (linux support for MSSQL is available now.)
- There is no way to escape curly braces in selectAlias(). Find a way.
- Transaction options.
- make getTransaction() callbacks so that the txOptions parameters can be ignored and callback fn can be the first param.
- loadById() too, in callback mode, currently it is necessary to put the "select" argument.
- documentation references tests, but they changed, update.
- test documenation change.
- new bf and toMany name creation algorithm documentation, pers doesn't throw upon failing autogen.
- add a section about .group() into the documentation and explain why it's not working like the rest of library and requires selectAlias().
- also put into docs that fields listed in the .selectAlias() don't map to the objects but become properties of the FROM object.
